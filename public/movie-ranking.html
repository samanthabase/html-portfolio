<h1>The Best Movies According to Sam</h1> 

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</h3>
<p>I would dream to have an afternoon of making snow angels in ice-cream or to be able to actually eat candy floss clouds.</p>

<h3>Hook</h3>
<p>This movie takes you into another realm of imagination and fun!</p>

<h3>Romeo & Juliet</h3>
<p>The 1996 adaptation with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The soundtrack alone was incredible, but the modernisation of the film, helped one understand the full story of what Shakespeare was trying to portray from his poetic words.</p>
